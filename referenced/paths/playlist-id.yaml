    Gets detailed metadata for a playlist. A playlist for many purposes (rating, editing metadata, tagging), can be treated like a regular metadata item:
    Smart playlist details contain the `content` attribute. This is the content URI for the generator. This can then be parsed by a client to provide smart playlist editing.
